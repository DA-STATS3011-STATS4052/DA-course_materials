The data contain the following variables:\n\n\ncity - the district of LA where the house was located\ntype - either SFR (Single Family Residences) or Condo/Twh (Condominium/Town House)\nbed - the number of bedrooms\nbath - the number of bathrooms\ngarage - the number of car spaces in the garage\nsqft - the floor area of the house (in square feet)\npool - Y if the house has a pool\nspa - TRUE if the house has a spa\nprice - the most recent sales price ($US)\nWe are interested in exploring the relationships between price and the other variables.\nRead the data into an object called LAhomes and answer the following questions.\n\n\nBy looking at the univariate and bivariate distributions on the price and sqft variables below, what would be a sensible way to proceed if we wanted to model this data? What care must be taken if you were to proceed this way?\n\n\nlibrary(gridExtra) # Package to display plots side by side\n\nhist1 &lt;- ggplot(LAhomes, aes(x = price)) +\n          geom_histogram()\n\nhist2 &lt;- ggplot(LAhomes, aes(x = sqft)) +\n          geom_histogram()\n\nhist1log &lt;- ggplot(LAhomes, aes(x = log(price))) +\n             geom_histogram()\n\nhist2log &lt;- ggplot(LAhomes, aes(x = log(sqft))) +\n             geom_histogram()\n\nplot1 &lt;- ggplot(LAhomes, aes(x = sqft, y = price)) +\n          geom_point()\n\nplot2 &lt;- ggplot(LAhomes, aes(x = log(sqft), y = log(price))) +\n          geom_point()\n\ngrid.arrange(hist1, hist2, hist1log, hist2log, plot1, plot2,\n             ncol = 2, nrow = 3)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution Given the highly skewed nature of both price and sqft (as seen in both their histograms and their scatterplot) the use of the log transformation significantly reduces the skewness in the data and makes the scatterplot look more linear. Hence we should model the transformed variables log(price) and log(sqft) instead of the original variables.\nIf these transformations are employed, special care must be taken when interpreting the meaning of estimated model parameters since the data are no longer on the original units and the linear models of the logged variables will have a multiplicative effect, rather than an additive effect, in the original units.\n\n\nFit the simple linear model with log(price) as the response and log(sqft) as the predictor. Display the fitted model on a scatterplot of the data and construct a bootstrap confidence interval (using the percentiles of the bootstrap distribution) for the slope parameter in the model and interpret its point and interval estimates.\n\nHint: Although you can supply the lm() function with terms like log(price) when you use the infer package to generate bootstrap intervals you the transformed variable needs to already exist. Use the mutate() function in the dplyr package to create new transformed variables.\n\nSolution\n\nLAhomes &lt;- mutate(LAhomes,log.price = log(price), log.sqft = log(sqft))\n\nslr.model1 &lt;- linear_reg()\nslr.model1 &lt;- slr.model1 |&gt;\n  fit(log(price) ~ log(sqft), data = LAhomes) |&gt;\n  extract_fit_engine()\n\nggplot(LAhomes,aes(x = log(sqft), y = log(price))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoeff &lt;- slr.model1 |&gt;\n          coef() \n\npercentile_beta_ci &lt;- LAhomes |&gt; \n  specify(log.price ~ log.sqft) |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") |&gt; \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\") |&gt;\n  get_ci(level = 0.95, type = \"percentile\")\n\nThe above plot shows the fitted line log(price)=2.7 + 1.44 log(sqft). The point estimate of the slope parameter estimates that for every unit increase in log(sqft) the average log(price) of houses will increase by 1.44 US dollars. Another way of saying this is that each additional 1% of square footage produces an estimate of the average price which is 1.44% higher (i.e. there is a multiplicative effect in the original units).\nNote: you must be careful to avoid causative interpretations. Additional square footage does not necessarily cause the price of a specific house to go up.\nFurthermore, based on the bootstrap confidence interval, we are 95% confident that the interval from 1.4 up to 1.48 contains the true rate of increase in the average of the logged prices as log(sqft) increase. Because this interval does not contain zero we conclude that the relationship between log(price) and log(sqft) is statistically significant.\n\n\nRepeat the analysis in part b. but with the log of the number of bathrooms (bath) as the single explanatory variable.\n\n\nSolution\n\nLAhomes &lt;- mutate(LAhomes, log.bath = log(bath))\n\nslr.model2 &lt;- linear_reg()\nslr.model2 &lt;- slr.model2 |&gt;\n  fit(log(price) ~ log(bath), data = LAhomes) |&gt;\n  extract_fit_engine()\n\nggplot(LAhomes,aes(x=log(bath),y=log(price)))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, se = FALSE)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoeff2 &lt;- slr.model2 |&gt;\n            coef() \n\npercentile_beta_ci2 &lt;- LAhomes |&gt; \n  specify(log.price ~ log.bath) |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") |&gt; \n  calculate(stat = \"slope\") |&gt;\n  get_ci(level = 0.95, type = \"percentile\")\n\nThe above plot shows the fitted line log(price)=12.23 + 1.43 log(bath). The point estimate of the slope parameter estimates that for every unit increase in the log of the number of bathrooms in a house the average log of the prices of houses will increase by 1.43 US dollars. Another way of saying this is that each doubling of bathroom produces an estimate of the average price which is 143% higher (i.e. there is a multiplicative effect in the original units).\nFurthermore, based on the bootstrap confidence interval, we are 95% confident that the interval from 1.36 up to 1.49 contains the true rate of increase in the average of the logged prices as the log of the number of bathrooms increases. Because this interval does not contain zero we conclude that the relationship between log(price) and log(bath) is statistically significant.\n\n\nFit the multiple linear regression model using the log transform of all the variables price (as the response) and both sqft and bath (as the explanatory variables). Calculate the point and interval estimates of the coefficients of the two predictors separately. Compare their point and interval estimates to those you calculated in parts b. and c. Can you account for the differences?\n\nHint: Remember that we didn’t use bootstrapping to construct the confidence intervals for parameters in multiple linear regression models, but rather used the theoretical results based on assumptions. You can access these estimates using the get_regression_table() function in the moderndive package.\n\nSolution\n\nmlr.model &lt;- linear_reg()\nmlr.model &lt;- mlr.model |&gt;\n  fit(log(price) ~ log(sqft)+log(bath), data = LAhomes) |&gt;\n  extract_fit_engine()\n\ncoeff3 &lt;- mlr.model |&gt;\n            coef() \n\nmlr.model.est &lt;- get_regression_table(mlr.model)\nglimpse(mlr.model.est)\n\nRows: 3\nColumns: 7\n$ term      &lt;chr&gt; \"intercept\", \"log(sqft)\", \"log(bath)\"\n$ estimate  &lt;dbl&gt; 2.514, 1.471, -0.039\n$ std_error &lt;dbl&gt; 0.262, 0.040, 0.045\n$ statistic &lt;dbl&gt; 9.601, 37.221, -0.862\n$ p_value   &lt;dbl&gt; 0.000, 0.000, 0.389\n$ lower_ci  &lt;dbl&gt; 2.000, 1.394, -0.128\n$ upper_ci  &lt;dbl&gt; 3.028, 1.549, 0.050\n\npercentile_beta1_ci &lt;- c(mlr.model.est$lower_ci[2], mlr.model.est$upper_ci[2])\npercentile_beta2_ci &lt;- c(mlr.model.est$lower_ci[3], mlr.model.est$upper_ci[3])\npercentile_beta1_ci\n\n[1] 1.394 1.549\n\npercentile_beta2_ci\n\n[1] -0.128  0.050\n\n\nThe fitted model is log(price)=2.51 + 1.47 log(sqft) - 0.04 log(bath). The first thing we notice is that the parameter associated with (the log of) the number of bathrooms has changed from 1.43 to -0.04. That it, its gone from having a positive relationship with the (log of) house prices in the single explanatory variable model to having a negative relationship when the size of the house was also included in the model. One reason for the switch in sign of the parameter estimate could be that for a house with a given size in (log) square feet, more (log) bathrooms means that less of the (log) square footage is used for bedrooms and other desirable space, thus reflecting a lower average home price. This illustrates the importance of taking all other variables in the model into account and holding them constant when we interpret individual parameter estimates in a multiple linear regression model. (See the “Formal Analysis” section here from Week 6’s lab).\nTurning to the confidence intervals, the model still predicts that the (log) square footage of the home significantly positively affects the average (log) price, since the 95% confidence interval for the log(sqft) parameter is from from 1.39 up to 1.55 which doesn’t contain zero. However, now the number of bathrooms no longer significantly affects the price since the 95% confidence interval for the log(bath) parameter is from from -0.13 up to 0.05 which does contain zero. This suggests that we drop the log(bath) term from the model and return to the simple linear regression model we used in part b.\n\n\nUsing the objective measures for model comparisons, which of the models in parts b., c. and d. would you favour?

This agrees with our conclusions in part d.\n\n\nYou have been asked to determine the pricing of a New York City (NYC) Italian restaurant’s dinner menu such that it is competitively positioned with other high-end Italian restaurants by analyzing pricing data that have been collected in order to produce a regression model to predict the price of dinner.\n\nData from surveys of customers of 168 Italian restaurants in the target area are available. The data can be found in the file restNYC.csv on the Moodle page. Each row represents one customer survey from Italian restaurants in NYC and includes the key variables:\n\nPrice - price (in $US) of dinner (including a tip and one drink)\nFood - customer rating of the food (from 1 to 30)\nDecor - customer rating of the decor (from 1 to 30)\nService - customer rating of the service (from 1 to 30)\nEast - dummy variable with the value 1 if the restaurant is east of Fifth Avenue, 0 otherwise\n\n\nUse the ggpairs function in the GGally package (see the following code) to generate an informative set of graphical and numerical summaries which illuminate the relationships between pairs of variables.

    "text": "Let’s expand upon what we learned last week by revisiting the instructor evaluation data set evals. In Week 3 you were tasked with examining the relationship between teaching score (score) and age (age). Now, let’s also introduce the additional (binary) categorical explanatory variable gender (gender). That is, we we will be examining:\n\nthe teaching score (score) as our outcome variable \\(y\\);\nage (age) as our numerical explanatory variable \\(x_1\\); and\ngender (gender) as our categorical explanatory variable \\(x_2\\).\n\n\nStart by subsetting the evals data set so that we only have the variables we are interested in, that is, score, age and gender.

The points have been jittered.\n\n\n\nNote: The above code has jittered the points, however, this is not necessary and geom_point would suffice. To plot separate points by gender we simply add the color argument to the aes function and pass to it gender.\nFrom the scatterplot we can see that:\n\nThere are very few women over the age of 60 in our data set.\nFrom the plotted regression lines we can see that the lines have different slopes for men and women. That is, the associated effect of increasing age appears to be more severe for women than it does for men, i.e. the teaching score of women drops faster with age.\n\nHere, we shall begin by fitting what is referred to as a parallel regression lines model. This model implies that the slope of relationship between teaching score (score) and age (age) is the same for both males and females, with only the intercept of the regression lines changing. Hence, our parallel regression lines model is given as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ny_{i} &= \\alpha + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + \\beta_2 x_{2i} + \\epsilon_i \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\alpha + \\beta_{\\mbox{age}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} + \\beta_{\\mbox{male}} \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_{\\mbox{male}}(x) + \\epsilon_i, \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) is the intercept of the regression line for females;\n\\(\\beta_{\\mbox{age}}\\) is the slope of the regression line for both males and females;\n\\(\\beta_{\\mbox{male}}\\) is the additional term added to \\(\\alpha\\) to get the intercept of the regression line for males; and\n\n\\(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mbox{male}}(x)\\) is an indicator function such that\n\\[\\mathbb{I}_{\\mbox{male}}(x)=\\left\\{\n            \\begin{array}{ll}\n              1 ~~~ \\mbox{If gender} ~ x ~ \\mbox{is male},\\\\\n              0 ~~~ \\mbox{Otherwise}.\\\\\n            \\end{array}\n          \\right.\\]\n\n\nWe can fit the parallel regression lines model as follows:\n\nCodelm_spec &lt;- linear_reg() |&gt; set_engine(\"lm\")\npar.model &lt;- lm_spec |&gt; fit(score ~ age + gender, data = eval.score)\npar.model &lt;- par.model |&gt; extract_fit_engine()\nget_regression_table(par.model)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 7\n  term         estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 intercept       4.48      0.125     35.8    0        4.24     4.73 \n2 age            -0.009     0.003     -3.28   0.001   -0.014   -0.003\n3 gender: male    0.191     0.052      3.63   0        0.087    0.294\n\n\nHence, the regression line for females is given by:\n\\[\\widehat{\\mbox{score}} = 4.48 - 0.009 \\cdot \\mbox{age},\\]\nwhile the regression line for males is given by:\n\\[\\widehat{\\mbox{score}} = 4.48 - 0.009 \\cdot \\mbox{age} + 0.191 = 4.671 - 0.009 \\cdot \\mbox{age}.\\] Now, let’s superimpose our parallel regression lines onto the scatterplot of teaching score against age:\n\nCodeggplot(eval.score, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Teaching Score\", color = \"Gender\") +\n  geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n Instructor evaluation scores by age and gender with parallel regression lines superimposed.\n\n\n\nFrom the parallel regression lines model both males and females have the same slope, that is, the associated effect of age on teaching score is the same for both men and women. Hence, for every one year increase in age, there is an associated decrease in teaching score of 0.009. However, male instructors have a higher intercept term, that is, there is a vertical bump in the regression line for males in teaching scores. This is linked to the average difference in teaching scores that males obtain relative to females.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nWhat is different between our previous scatterplot of teaching score against age and the one we just created with our parallel lines superimposed?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nIn the original plot we have what is referred to as an interaction effect between age and gender. Hence, gender interacts in different ways for both males and females by age, and as such we should have different intercepts and slopes.\n\n\n\n\nThere is an interaction effect if the associated effect of one variable depends on the value of another variable. For example, the effect of age here will depend on whether the instructor is male or female, that is, the effect of age on teaching scores will differ by gender. The interaction model can be written as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ny_{i} &= \\alpha + \\beta_1  x_{1i} + \\beta_2  x_{2i} + \\beta_3  x_{1i}  x_{2i} + \\epsilon_i \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\alpha + \\beta_{\\mbox{age}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} + \\beta_{\\mbox{male}} \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_{\\mbox{male}}(x) + \\beta_{\\mbox{age, male}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_{\\mbox{male}}(x) + \\epsilon_i, \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_{\\mbox{age, male}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_{\\mbox{male}}(x)\\) corresponds to the interaction term.\nMore concretely:\n\\[y_{i}=\\left\\{\n                \\begin{array}{ll}\n                  \\alpha + \\beta_{\\mbox{age}} \\cdot \\mbox{age} + \\epsilon_i ~~~ \\mbox{If gender} ~ x ~ \\mbox{is female},\\\\\n                  (\\alpha + \\beta_{\\mbox{male}}) + (\\beta_{\\mbox{age}} + \\beta_{\\mbox{age, male}}) \\cdot \\mbox{age} + \\epsilon_i ~~~ \\mbox{Otherwise}.\\\\\n                \\end{array}\n              \\right.\\]\nIn order to fit an interaction term within our regression model we replace the + sign with the * sign as follows:\n\nCodelm_spec &lt;- linear_reg()\nint.model &lt;- lm_spec |&gt; fit(score ~ age * gender, data = eval.score)\nint.model &lt;- int.model |&gt; extract_fit_engine()\nget_regression_table(int.model)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 7\n  term           estimate std_error statistic p_value lower_ci upper_ci\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 intercept         4.88      0.205     23.8    0        4.48     5.29 \n2 age              -0.018     0.004     -3.92   0       -0.026   -0.009\n3 gender: male     -0.446     0.265     -1.68   0.094   -0.968    0.076\n4 age:gendermale    0.014     0.006      2.45   0.015    0.003    0.024\n\n\nHence, the regression line for females is given by:\n\\[\\widehat{\\mbox{score}} = 4.88 - 0.018 \\cdot \\mbox{age},\\] while the regression line for males is given by:\n\\[\\widehat{\\mbox{score}} = 4.88 - 0.018 \\cdot \\mbox{age} - 0.446 + 0.014 \\cdot \\mbox{age} = 4.434 - 0.004 \\cdot \\mbox{age}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nHow do they compare with the teaching score values from the parallel regression lines model?\n\n\nAnswer\n\nHere, we can see that, although the intercept for male instructors may be lower, the associated average decrease in teaching score with age (0.004) is not as severe as it is for female instructors (0.018).\n\n\n\n\nNow we have to assess the fit of the model by looking at plots of the residuals. We shall do this for the interaction model. First, we need to obtain the fitted values and residuals from the interaction model as follows:\n\nCoderegression.points &lt;- get_regression_points(int.model)\n\n# A tibble: 463 × 6\n      ID score   age gender score_hat residual\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1   4.7    36 female      4.25    0.448\n 2     2   4.1    36 female      4.25   -0.152\n 3     3   3.9    36 female      4.25   -0.352\n 4     4   4.8    36 female      4.25    0.548\n 5     5   4.6    59 male        4.20    0.399\n 6     6   4.3    59 male        4.20    0.099\n 7     7   2.8    59 male        4.20   -1.40 \n 8     8   4.1    51 male        4.23   -0.133\n 9     9   3.4    51 male        4.23   -0.833\n10    10   4.5    40 female      4.18    0.318\n# ℹ 453 more rows\n\n\nLet’s start by looking at a scatterplot of the residuals against the explanatory variable by gender:\n\nCodeggplot(regression.points, aes(x = age, y = residual)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"age\", y = \"Residual\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ gender)\n\n\n\nResiduals vs the explanatory variable age by gender.\n\n\n\nNow, we can plot the residuals against the fitted values:\n\nCodeggplot(regression.points, aes(x = score_hat, y = residual)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Fitted values\", y = \"Residual\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~ gender)\n\n\n\nResiduals vs the fitted values.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s plot histograms of the residuals to assess whether they are normally distributed with mean zero:\n\nCodeggplot(regression.points, aes(x = residual)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Residual\") +\n  facet_wrap(~gender)\n\n\n\nHistograms of the residuals by gender."

In all 6 cases, the point estimate/sample statistic estimates the unknown population parameter. It does so by computing summary statistics based on a sample of size \\(n\\). We’ll cover Scenarios 5 and 6, namely construct CIs for the parameters in simple and multiple linear regression models. We will consider CIs based on theoretical results when standard assumptions hold, although sampling procedures such as bootstrap also exist. We will also consider how to use CIs for variable selection and finish by considering a model selection strategy based on objective measures for model comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Scenarios of sample statistics for inference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario\nPopulation Parameter\nPopulation Notation\nSample Statistic\nSample Notation\n\n\n\n1\nPopulation proportion\n\\(p\\)\nSample proportion\n\\(\\widehat{p}\\)\n\n\n2\nPopulation mean\n\\(\\mu\\)\nSample mean\n\\(\\bar{x}\\)\n\n\n3\nDiff.in pop. props\n\\(p_1 - p_2\\)\nDiff. in sample props\n\\(\\widehat{p}_1 - \\widehat{p}_2\\)\n\n\n4\nDiff. in pop. means\n\\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2\\)\nDiff. in sample means\n\\(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2\\)\n\n\n5\nPop. intercept\n\\(\\beta_0\\)\nSample intercept\n\n\\(\\widehat{\\beta}_0\\) or \\(b_0\\)\n\n\n\n6\nPop. slope\n\\(\\beta_1\\)\nSample slope\n\n\\(\\widehat{\\beta}_1\\) or \\(b_1\\)\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, we don’t have access to the population parameter values (if we did, why would we need to estimate them?) we only have a single sample of data from a larger population. We’d like to be able to make some reasonable guesses about population parameters using that single sample to create a range of plausible values for a population parameter. This range of plausible values is known as a confidence interval.\nThere are theoretical ways of defining confidence intervals for these different scenarios (such as you saw in ‘Statistical Inference’ in Semester 1). But we can also use a single sample to get some idea of how other samples might vary in terms of their sample statistics, i.e. to estimate the sampling distributions of sample statistics. One common way this is done is via a process known as bootstrapping.\nThe confidence intervals we will see this week are calculated using the theoretical results based on the standard assumptions that you will have seen in Regression Modelling in first semester. These values are not based on bootstrapping techniques since these become much harder to implement when working with multiple variables and its beyond the scope of this course."

Hence we should model the transformed variables log(price) and log(sqft) instead of the original variables.\nIf these transformations are employed, special care must be taken when interpreting the meaning of estimated model parameters since the data are no longer on the original units and the linear models of the logged variables will have a multiplicative effect, rather than an additive effect, in the original units.\n\n\nFit the simple linear model with log(price) as the response and log(sqft) as the predictor.

The point estimate of the slope parameter estimates that for every unit increase in log(sqft) the average log(price) of houses will increase by 1.44 US dollars. Another way of saying this is that each additional 1% of square footage produces an estimate of the average price which is 1.44% higher (i.e. there is a multiplicative effect in the original units).\nNote: you must be careful to avoid causative interpretations. Additional square footage does not necessarily cause the price of a specific house to go up.\nFurthermore, based on the confidence interval, we are 95% confident that the interval from 1.4 up to 1.48 contains the true rate of increase in the average of the logged prices as log(sqft) increase. Because this interval does not contain zero we conclude that the relationship between log(price) and log(sqft) is statistically significant.\n\n\nRepeat the analysis in part b. but with the log of the number of bathrooms (bath) as the single explanatory variable.\n\n\nSolution\n\nLAhomes &lt;- mutate(LAhomes, log.bath = log(bath))\n\nslr.model2 &lt;- linear_reg()\nslr.model2 &lt;- slr.model2 |&gt;\n  fit(log(price) ~ log(bath), data = LAhomes) |&gt;\n  extract_fit_engine()\n\nggplot(LAhomes,aes(x=log(bath),y=log(price)))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, se = FALSE)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoeff2 &lt;- slr.model2 |&gt;\n            coef() \n\nslr.model2.est &lt;- get_regression_table(slr.model2)\nglimpse(slr.model2.est)\n\nRows: 2\nColumns: 7\n$ term      &lt;chr&gt; \"intercept\", \"log(bath)\"\n$ estimate  &lt;dbl&gt; 12.231, 1.426\n$ std_error &lt;dbl&gt; 0.028, 0.031\n$ statistic &lt;dbl&gt; 437.232, 46.601\n$ p_value   &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0\n$ lower_ci  &lt;dbl&gt; 12.176, 1.366\n$ upper_ci  &lt;dbl&gt; 12.286, 1.486\n\npercentile_beta_ci2 &lt;- c(slr.model2.est$lower_ci[2], slr.model2.est$upper_ci[2])\npercentile_beta_ci2\n\n[1] 1.366 1.486\n\n\nThe above plot shows the fitted line log(price)=12.23 + 1.43 log(bath). The point estimate of the slope parameter estimates that for every unit increase in the log of the number of bathrooms in a house the average log of the prices of houses will increase by 1.43 US dollars. Another way of saying this is that each doubling of bathroom produces an estimate of the average price which is 143% higher (i.e. there is a multiplicative effect in the original units).\nBased on the confidence interval, we are 95% confident that the interval from 1.37 up to 1.49 contains the true rate of increase in the average of the logged prices as the log of the number of bathrooms increases. Because this interval does not contain zero we conclude that the relationship between log(price) and log(bath) is statistically significant.\n\n\nFit the multiple linear regression model using the log transform of all the variables price (as the response) and both sqft and bath (as the explanatory variables). Calculate the point and interval estimates of the coefficients of the two predictors separately.

The first thing we notice is that the parameter associated with (the log of) the number of bathrooms has changed from 1.43 to -0.04. That it, its gone from having a positive relationship with the (log of) house prices in the single explanatory variable model to having a negative relationship when the size of the house was also included in the model. One reason for the switch in sign of the parameter estimate could be that for a house with a given size in (log) square feet, more (log) bathrooms means that less of the (log) square footage is used for bedrooms and other desirable space, thus reflecting a lower average home price. This illustrates the importance of taking all other variables in the model into account and holding them constant when we interpret individual parameter estimates in a multiple linear regression model. (See the “Formal Analysis” section here from Week 6’s lab).\nTurning to the confidence intervals, the model still predicts that the (log) square footage of the home significantly positively affects the average (log) price, since the 95% confidence interval for the log(sqft) parameter is from from 1.39 up to 1.55 which doesn’t contain zero. However, now the number of bathrooms no longer significantly affects the price since the 95% confidence interval for the log(bath) parameter is from from -0.13 up to 0.05 which does contain zero. This suggests that we drop the log(bath) term from the model and return to the simple linear regression model we used in part b.\n\n\nUsing the objective measures for model comparisons, which of the models in parts b., c. and d. would you favour?

This agrees with our conclusions in part d.\n\n\nYou have been asked to determine the pricing of a New York City (NYC) Italian restaurant’s dinner menu such that it is competitively positioned with other high-end Italian restaurants by analyzing pricing data that have been collected in order to produce a regression model to predict the price of dinner.\n\nData from surveys of customers of 168 Italian restaurants in the target area are available. The data can be found in the file restNYC.csv on the Moodle page. Each row represents one customer survey from Italian restaurants in NYC and includes the key variables:\n\nPrice - price (in $US) of dinner (including a tip and one drink)\nFood - customer rating of the food (from 1 to 30)\nDecor - customer rating of the decor (from 1 to 30)\nService - customer rating of the service (from 1 to 30)\nEast - dummy variable with the value 1 if the restaurant is east of Fifth Avenue, 0 otherwise\n\n\nUse the ggpairs function in the GGally package (see the following code) to generate an informative set of graphical and numerical summaries which illuminate the relationships between pairs of variables.
