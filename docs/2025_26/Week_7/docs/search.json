These probabilities are calculated using equations (Equation 3) and (Equation 4) together with \\(p_1+p_2+p_3=1\\).

    "text": "Last week we introduced Generalised Linear Models (GLMs). Particularly, we looked at logistic regression to model outcomes of interest that take one of two categorical values (e.g.yes/no, success/failure, alive/dead). This week we will continue reviewing logistic regression to model grouped binary outcomes (e.g. number of successes out of a fixed number of trials) and then we we will generalise this to situations where the response variable is categorical with more than two categories. First lets look at the framework for modelling categorical data with only two categories, i.e.\n\nbinary, taking the value 1 (say success, with probability \\(p\\)) or 0 (failure, with probability \\(1-p\\)) or\nbinomial, where \\(y_i\\) is the number of events (successes) in a given number of trials \\(n_i\\), with the probability of success being \\(p_i\\) and the probability of failure being \\(1-p_i\\).\n\nIn both cases the distribution of \\(y_i\\) is assumed to be binomial, but in the first case it is \\(\\mathrm{Bin}(1,p_i)\\) and in the second case it is \\(\\mathrm{Bin}(n_i,p_i)\\). The first case was covered last week, so now lets focus on the second case.\nBefore we proceed, we will load all the packages needed for this week:\n\nCodelibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(yardstick)"

    "text": "2.1 Modelling grouped binary data with a categorical covariate\nIn the last section we reviewed the case when the explanatory variable was continuous., lets look now at the case when the explanatory variable is categorical.\nTo illustrate how the previous model works with categorical predictors we can discretised the temperature values into arbitrary categories as follows:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{temperature~ category} =\\begin{cases} \\mathrm{temperature} &gt; 29^\\circ C  &  \\text{high} \\\\ \\mathrm{temperature} &gt; 28^\\circ C& \\text{medium} \\\\ \\text{else} & \\text{low}\\end{cases}\n\\]\nIn R we can use the case_when() function to accomplish this:\n\nCodeturtles = turtles  %&gt;% mutate(\n  temp_fct = case_when(\n    temp &gt; 29 ~ \"high\",\n    temp &gt; 28 ~ \"medium\",\n    .default = \"low\"\n  ) %&gt;% as.factor()\n) \n\n\nNow, recall that as usual, R will set the baseline category for our explanatory variable in alphabetical order, i.e. the high temperature level will be treated as reference for the dicretised variable. However, we already know that the chances of a male being hatched increases with higher incubation temperatures.\nThus, it makes sense to assess how the chances of a male being hatched are affected by comparing higher temperature categories against lower ones. This implies that we will set low to be our reference category. Luckily, we have seen in previous tasks how to do this using the relevel() function:\n\nturtles = turtles %&gt;%\n  mutate(temp_fct = relevel(temp_fct,ref = \"low\")) \n\nWe can now fit a logistic regression using the low temperature level as the reference category for our dicretized temperature covariate. The model is then given by:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ny_i &\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n_ip_i)\\\\\n\\mathrm{logit}(p_i) &= \\alpha +  \\beta_{1}  \\times \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{temperature}}(\\mathrm{high}) + \\beta_{2}  \\times \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{temperature}}(\\mathrm{medium}).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) represent the log-odds of a male turtle being hatched in low incubation temperature.\n\\(\\beta_1\\) are the change int the log-odds of a male turtle being hatched given it was incubated in a high temperature condition compared to a low one.\n\\(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{temperature}}(\\mathrm{high})\\) is an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if the \\(i\\)th experiment replicate was conducted on a high temperature.\n\\(\\beta_2\\) are the change int the log-odds of a male turtle being hatched given it was incubated in a medium condition compared to a low one.\n\\(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{temperature}}(\\mathrm{medium})\\) is an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if the \\(i\\)th experiment replicate was conducted on a medium temperature.\n\nIn R, the model can be fitted as follows:\n\nmodel_turtles_2 &lt;- glm(cbind(male,female) ~ temp_fct,\n                     data = turtles,\n                     family = binomial)\n\nLets print the model estimates odds scale and 95% confidence intervals:\n\nmodel_turtles_2 %&gt;% tab_model(transform = \"exp\")\n\n\n\n\n \ncbind(male,female)\n\n\nPredictors\nOdds Ratios\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.59\n0.33 – 1.04\n0.072\n\n\ntemp fct [high]\n45.47\n8.59 – 843.97\n&lt;0.001\n\n\ntemp fct [medium]\n6.32\n2.76 – 15.31\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n15\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the odds of a male being hatched if it was incubated on a low temperature condition are 0.59 the odds of a female being hatched if it was incubated on the same condition.\nAlternatively, we could interpret this as the odds of female being hatched in a low temperature incubation settings being \\(\\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha)^{-1} =\\) 1.68 higher than the odds of a male being hatched under the same setting. However, there is not enough evidence to support that the change in the odds is statistically significant since the confidence interval ( 0.33 , 1.04) contains 1 (remember we are in the odds scale).\nOn the other hand, the odds of a male being hatched are 45.47! significantly higher in a high temperature setting compared to a low temperature. Likewise, the odds of a male being hatched are 6.32 higher in a medium temperature condition compared to a low one.\nComparing odds ratio\nWhat if we want to compare the odds of a male being hatched if the egg was incubate on a high temperature condition against a medium one?\nIn that case, we we will be looking at the following odds ratio:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{Odds}(\\mathrm{male}=1|\\mathrm{temperature}=high)}{\\mathrm{Odds}(\\mathrm{male}=1|\\mathrm{temperature}=medium)} &= \\dfrac{\\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha+\\beta_1)}{\\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha+\\beta_2)} \\\\&= \\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha+\\beta_1 - \\alpha - \\beta_2) \\\\&= \\mathrm{exp}(\\beta_1 - \\beta_2) = \\frac{\\mathrm{exp}(\\beta_1)}{ \\mathrm{exp}(\\beta_2)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) are the coefficients in the log-odd scale. However since we already have \\(\\mathrm{exp}(\\beta_1)=\\) 45.47 and \\(\\mathrm{exp}(\\beta_2)=\\) 6.32, then the odds of male being hatched from an egg that was incubated on a high temperature condition are \\(\\frac{45.47}{6.32}=\\) 7.2 greater than the one that was incubate on a medium temperature condition.\nCalculating probabilities\nFinally, we can calculate the probabilities of a male being hatched in each temperature condition as follows:\n\n\n\\(P(\\mathrm{male}=1|\\mathrm{temperature}=low) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{\\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha})}{1 + \\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha)}.\\) In R this is:\n\nplogis(coef(model_turtles_2)[1])\n\n(Intercept) \n   0.372549 \n\n\n\n\n\\(P(\\mathrm{male}=1|\\mathrm{temperature}=medium) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{\\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha + \\beta_1})}{1 + \\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha + \\beta_1)}.\\) In R this is equivalent to:\n\nplogis(coef(model_turtles_2)[1] + coef(model_turtles_2)[3])\n\n(Intercept) \n  0.7894737 \n\n\n\n\n\\(P(\\mathrm{male}=1|\\mathrm{temperature}=high) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{\\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha + \\beta_2})}{1 + \\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha + \\beta_2)}\\). In R this is computed as:\n\nplogis(coef(model_turtles_2)[1] + coef(model_turtles_2)[2])\n\n(Intercept) \n  0.9642857 \n\n\n\n\nWe can visualize these probabilities using the plot_model() function as follows:\n\nCodeplot_model(type = \"pred\",\n           model_turtles_2,\n           terms = \"temp_fct\",\n           axis.title = c(\"Temperature Category\",\n                          \"Prob. of a hatchling being male\"),\n           title = \" \")"

For example, the log-odds of considering the feature important vs no/little important for women between 24-40 are given by :\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{log}\\left(\\frac{p_{(\\text{important|age&gt;40,sex=women})}}{p_{(\\text{no/little|age &gt; 40,sex=women})}} \\right) &= \\hat{\\beta}_{0,\\text{important}}+\\hat{\\beta}_{1,\\text{important}} x_1 +\\hat{\\beta}_{2\\text{important}}x_2\\\\\n&= -0.98 +  0.39 + 1.13  \\approx 0.54\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHowever, it might be easier to interpret these coefficients in terms of odds for each logit equation. For example:\n\nmodel_cars %&gt;% tab_model(transform = \"exp\")\n\nFrom this table, we can see that the odds of considering the features important (versus no/little importance) for a person of the same gender over 40 years are 4.89 times the odds for 18-23 year old person (which is the baseline category for the age group). Remember that this is calculated based on the odds-ratio as follows:\n\\[\n\\require{cancel}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\text{Odds}(\\text{important|age &gt; 40 })}{\\text{Odds}(\\text{important|age [18-23] })} &= \\dfrac{\\exp(\\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{0,important}}} + \\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{1,important}}} x_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2,important}} \\cancelto{0}{x_2}+ \\hat{\\beta}_{3,\\text{important}} x_3 )}{\\exp(\\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{0,important}}} + \\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{1,important}}} x_1)}\\\\\n&= \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{3,\\text{important}} ) = 4.89\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn general, a positive coefficient (or greater than 1 odds multiplier) tells us that older people are more likely to consider the features important than young people, which is consistent with what we observed in the exploratory plots. Similarly, we can see that women are more likely than men to consider the features important, specifically the chances a woman finds these features important are 47% greater than men and more than twice consider these features as very important compared to men:\n\\[\n\\require{cancel}\n\\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{\\text{Odds}(\\text{important|sex = women })}{\\text{Odds}(\\text{important|sex= men })} &= \\dfrac{\\exp(\\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{0,important}}} + \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{1,important}} x_1 + \\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2,important}}} x_2+ \\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{3,\\text{important}}} x_3 )}{\\exp(\\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{0,important}}} + \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{1,important}} \\cancelto{0}{x_1} + \\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2,important}}} x_2 + \\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{3,\\text{important}}} x_3)}\\\\\n&= \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{1,\\text{important}}) = 1.47\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\require{cancel}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\text{Odds}(\\text{very important|sex = women })}{\\text{Odds}(\\text{very important|sex= men })} &= \\dfrac{\\exp(\\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{0, very very important}}} + \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{1, very important}} x_1 + \\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2,very important}}} x_2+ \\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{3,\\text{ very important}}} x_3 )}{\\exp(\\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{0,very important}}} + \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{1,very important}} \\cancelto{0}{x_1} + \\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2,important}}} x_2 + \\cancel{\\hat{\\beta}_{3,\\text{important}}} x_3)}\\\\\n&= \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_{1,\\text{very important}}) = 2.25\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHowever, in the first case, the difference between women and men is not statistically significant since the 95% CI contains 1."

Some of the statistics we can consider are:\n\nthe deviance \\(D=2[l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{\\max})-l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})]\\) (also referred to as residual deviance), where \\(l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{\\max})\\) is the maximised log-likelihood for the saturated (full) model and \\(l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})\\) is the maximised log-likelihood for the model of interest;\nthe likelihood ratio statistic, which is equal to the difference between the null deviance (deviance of the model with no predictors included) and the residual deviance for the model of interest;\nthe Akaike information criterion \\(AIC=-2l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}};\\mathbf{y})+2p\\), which equals the maximised log-likelihood of the model of interest plus a penalty term equal to twice the number of parameters in the model. The reason for this is that we can keep adding predictors to the model to improve the log-likelihood, but the cost is increased model complexity. The penalty term attempts to strike a balance between model complexity and how well the model fits.\n\nIf the model fits well, the deviance will be asymptotically \\(\\chi^2(N-p)\\), where \\(N\\) is \\(J-1\\) times the number of distinct covariate patterns in the data, and \\(p\\) is the number of parameters estimated.\nThe likelihood ratio statistic will be asymptotically \\(\\chi^2[p-(J-1)]\\) because the null (minimal) model will have one parameter for each logit defined in Equation 2.\nThe AIC can be used for model selection: calculate the criterion for each model and choose the one with the smallest value of the AIC.\nWe can compare the nominal logistic regression model with additive terms for age and sex with the null model by taking the difference in deviances (likelihood ratio test).\nThe null model can be fit as follows:\n\nmodel_null&lt;- multinom(response ~ 1, data=dcars, weights=frequency)\n\n# weights:  6 (2 variable)\ninitial  value 329.583687 \nfinal  value 329.272024 \nconverged\n\n\nTo see some model comparison metrics we can use the glance() function from the broom package:\n\nglance(model_null)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n    edf deviance   AIC  nobs\n  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     2     659.  663.    18\n\nglance(model_cars)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n    edf deviance   AIC  nobs\n  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1     8     581.  597.    18\n\n\nThe difference in deviance is \\(658.54-580.70=77.84\\) which is significant when compared with a \\(\\chi^2(8-2)\\):\n\nqchisq(df=6, p=0.95)\n\n[1] 12.59159\n\n# pval\npchisq(77.844,df=6,lower.tail = F)\n\n[1] 9.955365e-15\n\n\nAlternatively, we can run the likelihood ratio test using the anova function as follows:\n\nanova(model_null,model_cars,test = \"Chisq\")\n\nLikelihood ratio tests of Multinomial Models\n\nResponse: response\n      Model Resid. df Resid.

This is not significant when compared with a \\(\\chi^2(12-8)\\), so the additive model appears to fit the data well.\n\nqchisq(df=4, p=0.95)\n\n[1] 9.487729\n\n# pval\npchisq(3.94,df=4,lower.tail = F)\n\n[1] 0.4141869\n\n\nAgain, we can use the anova function to compare the three nested models:\n\nanova(model_null,model_cars,model_full,test = \"Chisq\") \n\nLikelihood ratio tests of Multinomial Models\n\nResponse: response\n      Model Resid. df Resid.

Suppose that we have these measurements from an iris and we wish to classify it into one of the three species.\nFit a nominal logistic regression model to the data and predict the probability of each species from the fitted model using sepal length as the only predictor.\nNote that you can use the predicted probabilities from a nominal logistic regression model to classify an observation to the category with the highest predicted probability.\n\n\nTake hint\n\nWe can get a list which assigns each observation to the category with the highest predicted probability using predict(your_model).\n\n\n\nSee solution\n\n\nm.iris &lt;- multinom(Species ~ Sepal.Length, data=iris)\n\n# weights:  9 (4 variable)\ninitial  value 164.791843 \niter  10 value 91.337114\niter  20 value 91.035008\nfinal  value 91.033971 \nconverged\n\ncbind(iris,predict(m.iris)) %&gt;% head()\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species predict(m.iris)\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa          setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa          setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa          setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa          setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa          setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa          setosa\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the car preferences example there was a natural ordering among the response categories that we have not accounted for. This ordering can be taken into account in the model specification. Unfortunately, we don’t have time to cover all of this in a single session. But please have a look at the extra material where we introduce the basis of ordinal logistic regression for ordered categorical responses."
