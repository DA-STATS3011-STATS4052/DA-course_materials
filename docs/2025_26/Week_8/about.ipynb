        "\n",

This will download a single file, archived and compressed using the common [ZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)) file format. Double-clicking the file will extract its contents to a folder next to the original .zip file.\n",
        "\n",
        "An important distinction here is that you are downloading just the codebase --- the files and folders of the repository --- and not the Git repository itself. This means you lose some of the key functionality of Git, for example, if the project maintainers make any updates to the project, you will need to manually re-download the `.zip` file and extract it again to see those changes, instead of being able to easily pull these changes (more on this in the next example!).\n",
