# Tasks

<!-- Create a Pull Request to an existing project -->

<!-- This tutorial is about contributing to someone else's project. The sample project that we are going to contribute to can be found here: -->

<!-- https://github.com/dmca-glasgow/tutorial2 -->

<!-- We're simply going to add a line to the existing readme.md file, but you may have found a bug, or thought of a new feature, in someone else's project, and you've taken it upon yourself to contribute and submit it to the project maintainer for approval. -->

<!-- In Git terms, what you need to do is: -->

<!-- Fork the project on GitHub to your account -->

<!-- Clone it to your local machine -->

<!-- Make the change -->

<!-- Stage, commit and push the change to GitHub -->

<!-- Create a Pull Request on the original project which points to your forked repository -->

<!-- Code review: the project maintainer will review your change to decide if they want to integrate it, close it, or request modifications -->
