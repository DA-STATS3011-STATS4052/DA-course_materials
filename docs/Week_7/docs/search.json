    "text": "Version control is used throughout industry and academia as a way of developing and sharing code. Some people tend to think of version control as simply being GitHub, but it’s important to be aware that version control is a much more general area and GitHub is just a useful way of hosting a version control system called Git. An alternative approach might be more appropriate for your project, thus we recommend thinking through the needs of your project before committing to one scheme, however Git/GitHub is often a good choice for version control, hence why we have created a course around it. GitHub, as a host for Git repositories, is widely used within both academia and industry.\nThere is an increasing requirement that graduates must have this skill and you may even start to see version control in some of your courses if you are a student. From an academic perspective, there is a drive for open-access code, data, and research. Releasing your code via GitHub can help others use your research, increasing its utility and driving the impact of your work.\n\nA Version Control System is a tool that helps keep track of code and software development projects as they change over time. The idea is to save snapshots of code at any given time, called versions, to allow developers to understand how the code was developed and if necessary revert (go back) to previous versions.\nWhen coding collaboratively researchers or developers can work on the same code base, keeping individual versions of the code separate from each other. These different sections are called branches, which you’ll learn about in this course, can later be combined by the system such that code that has stayed the same remains unchanged and changes made by each researcher or developer can be combined into one version."

Two of the most common ways of interacting with git/version control is either through the command line using the ‘git’ command or through a graphical user interface (GUI).\nTo address both needs throughout this course, you can either work through the examples using the command line or GitHub Desktop - a popular GUI (or compare both) for using Git. When you see a section that has a border around it, you can select either ‘Command-line’ or ‘GitHub Desktop’ at the top, and this will change all sections on the page to your preferred program."

Git is a command-line program, however, you can opt to install a graphical user interface (GUI) for Git such as GitHub Desktop and avoid having to open a command-line terminal at all if you don’t want to!\nIf you’re familiar with installing command-line tools, GitHub provides a short guide named Install Git that should get you up and running quickly.\nBelow are some additional tips for those needing a bit more guidance.\n\n2.2.1 For Mac users\nGit is a command-line tool that is usually already installed on Macs and can be accessed from the built-in terminal. The Terminal application can be found by navigating to the Applications/Utilities folder or searching for ‘Terminal’ in Spotlight.\n\n2.2.2 For Windows users\nThis Getting Started guide provides a bit more detail on which options to select during the installation process for the best experience.\nAfter clicking the “Download Git for Windows” button you will arrive at a GitHub Release page, with lots of variations to choose from.\nTo know which option is right for your system, first, you need to find out if your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit:\nGo to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; About. Check the bit version under Device specifications &gt; System type.\nThen choose the .exe file that matches your system:\n\nOnce installed, it can be accessed from the Git Bash terminal which comes included as part of the Git For Windows package. You can find Git Bash by opening the Start menu and typing ‘Git Bash’ into the search bar. However, if you plan on using a GUI for Git such as GitHub Desktop, you don’t need to open a terminal at all."

It’s also a valid workflow to first create a GitHub repository, then ‘clone’ it to your computer (see Unit 3).\nAs part of this course, you can either follow the instructions for Command-line or GitHub Desktop. Simply choose the tab you want below and all sections will change to the desired format. For example, the outline of the workflow is different for the two options, as GitHub Desktop automates some of the tasks:\n\n\nCommand-line\nGitHub Desktop\n\n\n\n\nCreate a local repository\nCreate a new file\nAdd the file to the Git ‘stage’\nCommit the file\nCreate a new repository on GitHub\nConfigure our local repository to point to the new GitHub repository as a remote ‘origin’\nPush our commit(s) to sync them with the repository on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a local repository\nCreate a file\nCommit the file\nPublish the repository on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we are going to look at how you update this file.

Importantly unlike (say) Dropbox, the changes in your project are not stored until you tell Git that they are ready to be stored i.e. in Git you ‘commit’ them.\nThe act of ‘committing’ in Git creates a ‘version’ (sometimes just called a ‘commit’). A version can be thought of as a snapshot of your whole project at that time. Once a commit has been made, it’s always possible to get back to this version. This simple concept can be extremely powerful for the evolution and maintenance of small to very large programming projects.\nEach version should be accompanied by a message describing the change made by the commit.

    "text": "13.1 Create a new repository on GitHub\nUp to this point, we have been using Git locally. Next, let’s learn how to put a copy of our project on GitHub to share it with others or just make a backup for ourselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate or Public Repository\n\n\n\nWhen creating a GitHub repository, you will need to decide if it will be private or public. Private will mean the code is only available to yourself and other contributors, but public will mean that anyone will be able to see your code. The purpose and stage of your project will determine which of these makes the most sense.\nThe decision is ultimately a pragmatic one, and can strongly depend on your particular circumstances, for example, you may wish to develop a new open-source software library in a public repository to encourage interest and contributions from others earlier, or you may wish to keep it private either for your own use only or until it is ready to be shared. Approaches to this can also vary, in some parts of Academia it is common to having a public repository on active research projects, in others a repository is made public once the project has finished.\nImportant: Be careful not to put anything sensitive on a public repository as it will be accessible to all, although it is probably not to put it on GitHub either way.\n\n\n\n\nCommand-line\nGit-Desktop\n\n\n\nTo be able to add our content to a GitHub page (remote repository), you will firstly need to create a repository. GitHub Desktop does this for you, but for the command-line, we need to do it ourselves. You can do this by following the Create a repo quickstart guide to create a new repository for our example. Here it is named “tutorial1” but you can name it whatever you like.\nThe Git command for syncing local commits with GitHub is push. Let’s try it now:\n\nCodegit push\n\n\nfatal: No configured push destination.\nEither specify the URL from the command-line or configure a remote repository using\n\n    git remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt;\n\nand then push using the remote name\n\n    git push &lt;name&gt;\nGit is telling us we still need to configure our local repository to use our new GitHub repository as a remote (a remote is a copy of our repository stored in another location, in this case on GitHub). When we ask Git to list the configured remotes there is no output:\n\nCodegit remote\n\n\norigin\nSo let’s set that up now.\nOn GitHub, copy the URL of your empty repository:\n\nAnd paste it in the following command:\n\nCodegit remote add origin &lt;your-repository-url&gt;\n\n\nYou can check git remote again:\n\nCodegit remote\n\n\norigin\n\nCodegit remote --verbose\n\n\norigin  https://github.com/dmca-glasgow/tutorial1.git (fetch)\norigin  https://github.com/dmca-glasgow/tutorial1.git (push)\nWe can see that our GitHub repository is configured for both fetch and push commands.\nNow let’s try to push again:\n\nCodegit push\n\n\nfatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin main\n\nTo have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking\nupstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.\nGit is telling us it can’t sync our local commits to main because GitHub doesn’t know about the main branch yet. So let’s follow its instructions to tell GitHub about this branch:\n\nCodegit push --set-upstream origin main\n\n\nTo https://github.com/dmca-glasgow/tutorial1.git\n  * [new branch]      main -&gt; main\nbranch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.\nAnd now, if we refresh our GitHub repository page, we should see our poem.txt file!\n\n\nIn GitHub Desktop, click the “Publish repository” tab, give it a name, and click the “Publish Repository” button:\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, if we refresh our GitHub repository page, we should see our poem.txt file!\n\nWe can click on the commits icon:\n\nTo view our commit history:\n\nAnd we can click on the branches button to view our main branch:"

To be more precise, we are telling Git to ignore these files from our project folder by not adding them to any commit change list.\n.gitignore files use a simple syntax to make it easy to match files. The entries in this file can also follow a matching pattern.\n\n\n* is used as a wildcard match\n\n/ is used to ignore pathnames relative to the .gitignore file\n\n# is used to add comments to a .gitignore file\n\nFor example:\n# &lt;-- comments start with a hash sign\n# empty lines are ignored\n\n# ignore 'passwords.txt' at the root of your project:\n/passwords.txt\n\n# ignore 'passwords.txt' anywhere in your project:\npasswords.txt\n\n# ignore 'cache' folder  at the root of your project:\n/cache/\n\n# ignore all 'cache' folders:\ncache/\n\n# ignore all .log files inside a 'logs' folder:\nlogs/*.log\n\n# ignore all .html files inside the 'logs' folder including sub-folders:\nlogs/**/*.log\n\n# ignore all files with .log extension:\n**/*.log\nIf a file has already been committed to Git, ignoring it with .gitignore won’t remove it from the repository, only it’s changes from that point on. If you’d like to remove a file from Git, the simplest way is to follow these steps:\n\nMove the file out of your project folder\nGit will treat the file as deleted. Stage and commit this change.\nAdd the file path to .gitignore\nMove the file back into your project folder\nCheck the stage and confirm that Git is ignoring it\nCommit the updated .gitignore file\n\nHowever, while the file has been removed it is still present in your history in future sections."
