# Tasks

1.  Examine the relationship between teaching score and age in the `evals` data set. What is the value of the correlation coefficient? How would you interpret this verbally? Finally, produce a scatterplot of teaching score and age.

```{r task2-solution, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
evals.age <- evals |>
  select(score, age)
evals.age |>
  get_correlation(formula = score ~ age)
ggplot(evals.age, aes(x = age, y = score)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Teaching Score",
       title = "Relationship between Teaching Score and Age")
```

\newpage

2.  Perform a formal analysis of the relationship between teaching score and age by fitting a simple linear regression model. Superimpose your best-fitting line onto your scatterplot from Task 1.

```{r task3-solution, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
evals.age <- evals |>
  select(score, age)
model <- linear_reg() |> fit(score ~ age, data = evals.age)
model$fit
ggplot(evals.age, aes(x = age, y = score)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Teaching Score",
       title = "Relationship between Teaching Score and Age") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

\newpage

3.  Assess the model assumptions from Task 2 by plotting the residuals against the explanatory variable and fitted values, respectively. Also, plot a histogram of the residuals to assess whether they are normally distributed.

```{r task4-solution, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
evals.age <- evals |>
  select(score, age)
model <- linear_reg() |> fit(score ~ age, data = evals.age)
regression.points <- get_regression_points(model$fit)
ggplot(regression.points, aes(x = age, y = residual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Residual") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "blue", size = 1)

ggplot(regression.points, aes(x = score_hat, y = residual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Fitted values", y = "Residual") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "blue", size = 1)

ggplot(regression.points, aes(x = residual)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Residual")
```

\newpage

4.  Perform the same analysis we did on life expectancy from the `gapminder` data set in 2007. However, subset the data for the year 1997. Are there any differences in the results across this 10 year period?

    ```{r}
    gapminder1997 <- gapminder |>
      filter(year == 1997) |>
      select(country, continent, lifeExp)

    lifeExp.continent <- gapminder1997 |>
      summarize(median = median(lifeExp), mean = mean(lifeExp),.by=continent)
    lifeExp.continent

    lifeExp.model <- linear_reg() |> fit(lifeExp ~ continent, data = gapminder1997)
    lifeExp.model
    ```

    \newpage

5.  Return to the `Credit` data set and fit a multiple regression model with `Balance` as the outcome variable, and `Income` and `Age` as the explanatory variables, respectively. Assess the assumptions of the multiple regression model.

```{r task2, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, out.width = '60%'}

Cred <- Credit |>
  select(Balance, Income, Age)

Cred |>
  skim()

Cred |>
  cor()

ggplot(Cred, aes(x = Age, y = Balance)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age (in years)", y = "Credit card balance (in $)",
       title = "Relationship between balance and age") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

Balance.model <- linear_reg() |> fit(Balance ~ Age + Income, data = Cred)
tidy(Balance.model)

regression.points <- get_regression_points(Balance.model$fit)

ggplot(regression.points, aes(x = Income, y = residual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Income (in $1000)", y = "Residual", title = "Residuals vs income")  +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "blue", size = 1)

ggplot(regression.points, aes(x = Age, y = residual)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age (in years)", y = "Residual", title = "Residuals vs age")  +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "blue", size = 1)

ggplot(regression.points, aes(x = residual)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Residual")
```
