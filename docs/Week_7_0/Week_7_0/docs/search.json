    "text": "Case 1: Yanny or Laurel?\nThis auditory illusion first appeared on the internet in May 2018. An explanation of why people hear different things can be found in this short video, just one of many internet sources discussing the phenomenon. The main reason behind the difference appears to be that as we age we lose the ability to hear certain sounds. To see if we could find evidence of such an age effect, we asked students and staff at the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Glasgow to fill out a survey on what they hear. Below you can see summaries of the responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportions hearing Yanny and Laurel are very similar to each other, and there are some respondents who hear both or even something completely different. This may be because people do not listen to the audio file using the same device, something we couldn’t control for in the survey. Ignoring the responses other than Yanny or Laurel, we have 53 observations.\nDownload the yanny.csv data and fit a logistic regression model with hear as the binary response variable, and age and gender as the explanatory variables. What are your findings?\n\n\n Download yanny.csv\n\n\n\n\nCase 2: Surviving the Titanic\nOn 15th April 1912, during its maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\nDownload the data (titanic.csv) for \\(n = 891\\) passengers aboard the Titanic and fit a logistic regression model with survived as the binary response variable, and age, gender, and passenger.class as the explanatory variables.

Hence we make the assumption that the outcomes \\(y_i\\) are normally distributed with mean \\(\\alpha + \\beta x_i\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). However, what if our response variable \\(y\\) is not a continuous random variable?\n\nThe main objective this week is to introduce Generalised Linear Models (GLMs), which extend the linear model framework to response variables that don’t follow the normal distribution. GLMs can be used to model non-normal continuous response variables, but they are most frequently used to model binary, categorical or count data. The generalised linear model can be written as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ny_i &\\sim f(g(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_i)) \\nonumber \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_i &= \\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere the response \\(y_i\\) is predicted through the linear combination \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_i\\) of explanatory variables by the link function \\(g(\\cdot)\\), assuming some distribution \\(f(\\cdot)\\) for \\(y_i\\), and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) row of the design matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{X}\\). For example, the simple linear regression model above for a continuous response variable has the normal distribution distribution as \\(f(\\cdot)\\), with corresponding link function equal to the Identity function, that is, \\(g(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_i) = \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_i\\).\nThis week we will learn how to model outcomes of interest that take one of two categorical values (e.g. yes/no, success/failure, alive/dead).\n\nbinary, taking the value 1 (say success, with probability \\(p_i\\)) or 0 (failure, with probability \\(1-p_i\\)) or\nbinomial, where \\(y_i\\) is the number of successes in a given number of trials \\(n_i\\), with the probability of success being \\(p_i\\) and the probability of failure being \\(1-p_i\\).\n\nIn both cases the distribution of \\(y_i\\) is assumed to be binomial, but in the first case it is Bin\\((1,p_i)\\) and in the second case it is Bin\\((n_i,p_i)\\). Hence, a binary response variable \\(y_i\\) has a binomial distribution with corresponding link function \\(g(\\cdot)\\) , e.g. the logit link function, that is\n\\[g(p_i) = \\log \\left(\\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i} \\right),\\]\nwhich is also referred to as the log-odds (since \\(p_i ~ / ~ 1-p_i\\) is an odds ratio). Why is such a transformation required when looking at a binary response variable? Well here we are interested in modelling the probability of success \\(p_i\\), and as we know probabilities must be between 0 and 1 \\(\\left(p_i \\in [0, 1]\\right)\\). So if we want to model the probability of success using a linear model we need to ensure that the probabilities obtained are between 0 and 1. However, if we just use the identity link function, such that\n\\[p_i = \\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta},\\] we would need to ensure that in some way \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\in [0, 1]\\), that is, the linear combination of the explanatory variables and their corresponding regression coefficients was between 0 and 1. Hence some restrictions of some sort would need to be put in place to ensure this was the case.

    "text": "2.3 Odds\nTypically we would like to work on the odds scale as it is easier to interpret an odds-ratio as opposed to the log-odds-ratio. To obtain the odds we simply exponentiate the log-odds, that is\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{p}{1-p} &= \\exp\\left(\\alpha + \\beta \\cdot \\textrm{age} \\right), \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nmodel %&gt;% tidy(exponentiate = T)\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.07\n0.51\n-5.27\n0\n\n\nage\n1.06\n0.01\n5.95\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the odds scale, the value of the intercept (0.07) gives the odds of a teaching instructor being male given their age = 0, which is obviously not a viable age for a teaching instructor, and hence why this value is very close to zero. For age we have an odds of 1.06, which indicates that for every 1 unit increase in age, the odds of the teaching instructor being male increase by a factor of 1.06.\nSo how is this calculated? Let’s look at the odds-ratio obtained from instructors aged 51 and 52 years old, that is, a one unit difference:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\mbox{Odds}_{\\mbox{age=52}}}{\\mbox{Odds}_{\\mbox{age=51}}} &= \\left(\\frac{\\frac{p_{\\mbox{age=52}}}{1 - p_{\\mbox{age=52}}}}{\\frac{p_{\\mbox{age=51}}}{1 - p_{\\mbox{age=51}}}}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\alpha + \\beta \\cdot 52\\right)}{\\exp\\left(\\alpha + \\beta \\cdot 51\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\beta \\cdot (52 - 51)\\right) \\\\\n&= \\exp\\left(0.06\\right) = 1.06. \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nFor example, the odds of a teaching instructor who is 45 years old being male is given by\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{p}{1-p} &= \\exp\\left(\\alpha + \\beta \\cdot \\textrm{age}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-2.7 + 0.06 \\cdot 45\\right) = 1.15. \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis can be interpreted as the chances of an instructor who is 45 being male are 15% greater than them being female. We can obtain a 95% confidence interval for the odds by simply exponentiating the lower and upper bounds of our log-odds interval:\n\nmodel %&gt;% tidy(exponentiate = T,conf.int = T) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\nconf.low\nconf.high\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.07\n0.51\n-5.27\n0\n0.02\n0.18\n\n\nage\n1.06\n0.01\n5.95\n0\n1.04\n1.09\n\n\n\n\n\nHence the point estimate for the odds is 1.06, which has a corresponding 95% confidence interval of (1.04, 1.09). This can be displayed graphically using the plot_model function from the sjPlot package by simply passing our model as an argument as well as removing transform = NULL (the default transformation is exponential):\n\nCodeplot_model(model, show.values = TRUE,\n           title = \"Odds (Male instructor)\", show.p = FALSE, axis.lim = c(1, 1.5))\n\n\n\nThe odds of age for male instructors.\n\n\n\nNote: axis.lim is used to zoom in on the 95% confidence interval."

(Gabry et al. 2019) and check_predictions() for further details)\nBinned residuals (Top-right): Bin the observations based on their fitted values, and average the residual value in each bin. The plots shows the average residual values versus the average fitted value for each bin” (Gelman and Hill 2006). If the model were true, one would expect about 95% of the residuals to fall inside the error bounds (see ?binned_residuals for more details.)\nInfluential observations (Bottom-left): This plot is used to identify influential observations. If any points in this plot fall outside of Cook’s distance (the dashed lines) then it is considered an influential observation. See check_outliers() for further details.\nUniformity of residuals (Bottom-right): Since our response is not normally distributed, residuals are not expected to be normally distributed either.

To do so we can compute a confusion matrix according to the true and predicted classes:\n\n\n\n\nThe table can be interpreted as follows:\n\nThe correct classification rate (CCR) or accuracy describes the overall proportion of teaching instructors (males or females) that were classified correctly among all the \\(S = 463\\) individuals.\nThe true positive rate (TPR) or sensitivity (a.k.a. recall), denotes the proportion of actual female instructors that are correctly classified as females by the model.\nThe true negative rate (TNR) or specificity, denotes the proportion of actual males that have been classified correctly as males by the model. Note: the false positive rate (FPR) computed as (1- specificity) is another popular metric that measures the proportion of actual negatives that are incorrectly predicted as positive.\nThe model’s precision or positive predictive value (PPV) represents the proportion of predicted female instructors that were actually female, i.e. how many of the predicted positive cases were actually positive.\nThe model’s negative predictive value (NPV) represents the proportion of predicted male instructors that were actually males, i.e. how many of the predicted negative cases were actually negative.\n\nTo compute the confusion matrix we can use the conf_mat() function and use as input the data frame with the predicted and observed classes as follows:\n\nconf_mat(pred_results,truth = gender,estimate = predicted_class)\n\n          Truth\nPrediction female male\n    female     76   60\n    male      119  208\n\n\nRather than computing these predictive performance metrics by hand, we can take advantage of the metric_set() function from the yardstick library (loaded as part of the tidymodels ecosystem) to combine multiple metric functions together into a new function that calculates all of them at once. Then we just simply need to supply the same arguments we used for computing the confusion matrix.\n\n# Step (1) create a set with classification metrics we want to compute\neval_metric &lt;- metric_set(accuracy,sensitivity,specificity,ppv,npv)\n# Step (2) call out the metric set and input the data containing the observed and predicted classes\neval_metric(pred_results,truth = gender,estimate = predicted_class)\n\n\n\n\n\n.metric\n.estimator\n.estimate\n\n\n\naccuracy\nbinary\n0.61\n\n\nsensitivity\nbinary\n0.39\n\n\nspecificity\nbinary\n0.78\n\n\nppv\nbinary\n0.56\n\n\nnpv\nbinary\n0.64\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that our model is not doing a great job in predicting the outcome (accuracy of \\(\\approx\\) 60%).This is due to a particularly poor performance in terms of sensitivity, i.e. roughly only 40% of truly female instructors are correctly classified as such by our mode. Despite this, our model is not doing a terrible job in terms of specificity since almost 80% of the males are actually being predicted as such.\nNote that the threshold of 0.5 is common but may not always be optimal. You can adjust it based on your specific application and the desired balance between sensitivity and specificity (we will see an example of such in the next task)."

    "text": "3.3 ROC Curve\nAnother way to assess how good the model is at separating the 2 classes of the outcome is through the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is a graphical representation used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. It shows the trade-off between the true positive rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various threshold settings.\nThe threshold determines the cutoff probability for classifying a sample as positive or negative (male or female in our case).\n\nAt a cutoff \\(=0\\) , all the observations will be classified as positive (i.e. all the instructors are going to be classified as males since we are modelling the event \\(P(male)\\)).\nAt a cutoff \\(=1\\) , all the observations will be classified as negative (i.e. all the instructors are going to be classified as females corresponding to \\(1 - P(male)\\)).\n\nAs the threshold moves between 0 and 1, the ROC curve traces out points that show the model’s performance for various balances between TPR and FPR.\nWe can combine the roc_curve() function from the performance library and autoplot() function from ggplot to calculate and visualize the ROC curve.

This means high true positive rates (sensitivity) and low false positive rates. The closer the curve is to the diagonal line (i.e. when TPR = FPR) then the performance is no better than random guessing. We can see here that our model is doing a little bit better than just random guessing.\nWe can also calculate the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a single value to summarize the model’s performance:\n\nroc_auc(pred_results,\n        truth = gender,\n        .fitted,\n        event_level = \"second\")\n\n\n\n\n\n.metric\n.estimator\n.estimate\n\n\nroc_auc\nbinary\n0.66\n\n\n\n\nThe AUC ranges from 0 to 1:\n\nAUC = 1: Perfect classifier.\nAUC = 0.5: No better than random guessing.\nAUC \\(\\leq\\) 0.5: Worse than random guessing, meaning the model is consistently misclassifying.\n\nAgain, the AUC of 0.66 indicates a moderate-poor fit to the data (mainly due to miss-classifications of female instructors as we saw previously).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Task\n\n\n\nThe Youden index (Youden’s J statistics) is a summary metric that helps to identify the optimal threshold that maximizes both sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) simultaneously.

Thus, \\(p_i = \\mathrm{Prob}(\\mathrm{Male})\\) is linked to the linear predictor through the logit link function. This means that estimates we get from fitting the logistic regression model are for a change on the log-odds scale for males (\\(p_i = \\textrm{Prob}(\\textrm{Males})\\)) in comparison to the response baseline females.\nAlso, the baseline category for our explanatory variable is minority, which, like gender, is done alphabetically by default by R:\n\nlevels(evals.ethnic$ethnicity)\n\n[1] \"minority\"     \"not minority\"\n\n\nThus, \\(\\alpha\\) correspond to the log-odds of the instructors being a males given that they are on the minority baseline category.\nThen, \\(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mbox{ethnicity}}(\\mbox{not minority})\\) is an indicator function for those instructors in the not minority group and \\(\\beta_{\\mbox{ethnicity}}\\) represent the change in the log-odds of a male instructor that is not on the minority group.\nLets break this down. The model we have fitted is:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{log}\\left(\\dfrac{p_i}{1-p_i}\\right) = \\alpha + \\beta_{\\mbox{ethnicity}}  \\times \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{ethnicity}}(\\mathrm{not~  minority})\n\\]\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) is the intercept, representing the log-odds when \\(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{ethnicity}}(\\mathrm{not~ minority}) = 0\\) (i.e., when the instructor is in the minority group). When the instructor belongs to the reference category minority the models simplifies to: \\[\\mathrm{log}\\left(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\\right) = \\alpha \\]\n\\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{ethnicity}}\\) is the coefficient for the predictor \\(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{ethnicity}}(\\mathrm{not~ minority})\\), which shows how the log-odds change when moving from the reference category (minority) to the other level (not minority). When the instructor does not belong to reference category, i.e. \\(\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{ethnicity}}(\\mathrm{not~ minority}) = 1\\), the model becomes: \\[\\mathrm{log}\\left(\\dfrac{p_i}{1-p_i}\\right) = \\alpha + \\beta_{\\mbox{ethnicity}}\\]\n\nSo, the log-odds of the instructors being male in the not minority group are \\(\\alpha +\\beta_{\\mbox{ethnicity}}\\). Lets compute the model estimates and 95 % confidence intervals for the log-odds:\n\nmodel.ethnic %&gt;%\n  tidy(conf.int = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\nconf.low\nconf.high\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.25\n0.25\n-1.00\n0.32\n-0.75\n0.24\n\n\nethnicitynot minority\n0.66\n0.27\n2.44\n0.01\n0.13\n1.20\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fitted model is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\hat{p_i}}{1-\\hat{p_i}}\\right) &= -0.25 + 0.66 \\cdot \\mathbb{I}_{\\mbox{ethnicity}}(\\mbox{not minority}), \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nHence, the log-odds of an instructor being male increase by 0.66 if they are in the ethnicity group not minority, which has a corresponding 95% confidence interval of (0.13, 1.2).\nThis can be displayed graphically using the plot_model function from the sjPlot package by simply passing our model as an argument:\n\nCodeplot_model(model.ethnic, show.values = TRUE, transform = NULL, \n           title = \"Log-Odds (Male instructor)\", show.p = FALSE)\n\n\n\nThe log-odds for male instructors by ethnicity (not a minority)."

First, the odds of the instructor being male given that they are in the minority ethnic group (reference category) can be obtained as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Odds}(\\mathrm{male = 1} | \\mathrm{minority} =1) &= \\dfrac{p_{(minority=1)}}{1 - p_{(minority=1)}}\\\\\n&= \\exp\\left(\\alpha\\right) \\\\\n&= \\exp\\left(-0.25\\right) \\\\\n&= 0.78. \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\nHere, \\(p_{(minority=1)} = \\mathrm{Prob}\\left(\\mathrm{Male}=1 | \\mathrm{minority}=1\\right)\\). Thus, the odds of the instructor in the minority group being a male are 0.78 the odds of an instructor being a female in the same group.\nSlightly confusing right? Maybe it makes more sense to interpret this result in terms of the female group, i.e. \\(\\mathrm{Odds}(\\mathrm{female} = 1 | \\mathrm{minority} =1)\\). However you must be aware that this is not a probability! so you can not simply compute \\(1- \\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha)\\). To compute this correctly, we should do as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Odds}(\\mathrm{female} = 1 | \\mathrm{minority} =1) &= \\dfrac{P(\\mathrm{female}=1 |\\mathrm{minority}=1)}{P(\\mathrm{male}= 1 |\\mathrm{minority}=1)}\\\\\n&= \\left[\\dfrac{P(\\mathrm{male}=1 |\\mathrm{minority}=1)}{P(\\mathrm{female}= 1 |\\mathrm{minority}=1)}\\right]^{-1}\\\\\n&= \\left[\\mathrm{Odds}(\\mathrm{male}=1|\\mathrm{minority}=1)\\right]^{-1}\\\\\n&= \\mathrm{exp}(\\alpha)^{-1} \\\\ &= \\exp\\left(-0.25\\right)^{-1} = 1.28\n\\end{align}\\]\nThus, the odds of the instructor in the minority group being a female are 28% higher than the odds of an instructor being a male in the same group. However, by looking at the confidence intervals and p-value we can see that this difference is not statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Task\n\n\n\nUse the relevel function to fit a logistic regression that estimates the odds of the instructor being female given that they are in the minority ethnic group directly.\n\n\nTake hint\n\nThe reference category in your data can be changed by using the relevel() function. see ?relevel for further details.\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see the solution\n\nevals.ethnic %&gt;%\n  mutate(gender = relevel(gender,ref = \"male\")) %&gt;% \n  glm(gender ~ ethnicity, data = . ,family = binomial) %&gt;%  \n  broom::tidy(exponentiate = T) %&gt;% \n  filter(term==\"(Intercept)\") %&gt;%\n  pull(estimate) \n\n[1] 1.285714\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s look a the odds-ratio of an instructor being male in the not minority group compared to the minority ethnic group.\n\n\nFirst, the odds of an instructor being male given that they are in the minority ethnic group were:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Odds}(\\mathrm{male} = 1 | \\mathrm{minority} = 1) =&\n\\dfrac{p_{(minority=1)}}{1 - p_{(minority=1)}} \\\\\n&= \\exp\\left(\\alpha\\right) \\\\ &= 0.78. \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nRecall that the log-odds of an instructor not belonging to the minority group (i.e. not minority) being a male are \\(\\alpha +\\beta_{\\mbox{ethnicity}}\\). On the odds scale this is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Odds}(\\mathrm{male} = 1 | \\mathrm{minority} = 0) =& \\dfrac{p_{(\\mathrm{minority} = 0)}}{1- p_{(\\mathrm{minority} = 0)}}\\\\\n&= \\mathrm{exp}( \\alpha + \\beta_{\\mbox{ethnicity}}) \\\\\n&= 1.51\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nNow, the odds of an instructor that is not in the minority group being male against the odds of an instructor that comes from the minority group is given by the ratio of the odds we just calculated:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{Odds}(\\mathrm{male} = 1| \\mathrm{minority} = 0)}{\\mathrm{Odds}(\\mathrm{male} = 1| \\mathrm{minority} = 1)} &= \\dfrac{\\frac{p_{(\\mathrm{minority} = 0)}}{1- p_{(\\mathrm{minority} = 0)}}}{\\frac{p_{(\\mathrm{minority}=1)}}{1- p_{(\\mathrm{minority}=1)}}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\mathrm{exp}( \\alpha + \\beta_{\\mbox{ethnicity}})}{\\exp\\left(\\alpha\\right)}\\\\\n&= \\exp\\left(\\alpha + \\beta_{\\mbox{ethnicity}} - \\alpha\\right) \\\\\n&= \\exp\\left(\\beta_{\\mbox{ethnicity}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(0.66 \\right) \\\\\n&= 1.93. \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nWhich is the coefficient estimate we got from the tidy() summaries. This means that instructors that are not in the minority groups are significantly 1.93 times more likely to be males compared to instructors in the minority group.\nThe corresponding 95% confidence interval of (1.14, 3.33). Again, we can display this graphically using the plot_model function from the sjPlot package:\n\nCodeplot_model(model.ethnic, show.values = TRUE,\n           title = \"Odds (Male instructor)\", show.p = FALSE)\n\n\n\nThe odds-ratio of a male instructor given they are in the not minority group."
