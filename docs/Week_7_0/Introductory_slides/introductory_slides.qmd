## ILOs

By the end of this session you will be able to:

-   Fit a logistic regression model with either a numerical or categorical explanatory variable:

-   Interpret the regression coefficients of the logistic model in terms of their effects on both the odds and the log odds (of the response)

    -   embed and compile R -code.

    -   Include external and self-generated plots/figures.

    -   Create tables and write latex-mathematical notations.

-   Authoring presentation using quarto with some interactive features.

# Overview of today's session

## Logistic regression {.smaller}

This week we will learn how to model outcomes of interest that take one of two categorical values (e.g. yes/no, success/failure, alive/dead), i.e.

-   **binary**, taking the value 1 (say success, with probability $p_i$) or 0 (failure, with probability $1-p_i$) or

In this case,

$$
y_i \sim \mathrm{Bin}(1,p_i)\\
g(p_i) = \log \left(\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i} \right)
$$

which is also referred to as the **log-odds** (since $p_i ~ / ~ 1-p_i$ is an odds ratio).

$$p_i = \frac{\exp\left(\mathbf{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta}\right)}{1 + \exp\left(\mathbf{x}_i^\top \boldsymbol{\beta}\right)} ~~~ \in [0, 1].$$

## Required R packages {.unnumbered}

Before we proceed, load all the packages needed for this week:

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: false
#| echo: true

library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(moderndive)
library(sjPlot)
library(tidymodels)
library(broom)
library(performance)
library(janitor)
```

## First example - Teaching evaluation scores {.unnumbered}

`evals` data set available from the `moderndive` R package.

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| echo: true

evals.gender <- evals %>%
                  select(gender, age)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-align: center

ggplot(data = evals.gender, aes(x = gender, y = age, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Age") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

## Fitting a logistic regression in R {.unnumbered}

$$
\log\left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right) = \alpha + \beta 
$$

where $p = \textrm{Prob}\left(\textrm{Male}\right)$ and $1 - p = \textrm{Prob}\left(\textrm{Female}\right)$.

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| eval: false 
#| echo: true
model <- glm(gender ~ age, data = evals.gender,family = binomial)
model %>% broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.95)
```

```{r mod1sum, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
model <- glm(gender ~ age, data = evals.gender,family = binomial)
model %>%   broom::tidy() %>% knitr::kable()
```

## Model evaluation

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: true
library(performance)
check_model(model, panel = TRUE)
```

## **Predictive performance metrics** {.smaller}

How well our model predicts new observations?

-   compute the **predicted classes** and compare them against the **observed values**.

-   We typically classify these probabilities into discrete classes based on a **threshold** (commonly 0.5 for binary classification)We can set a threshold

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| echo: true

pred_results = model %>% 
  augment(type.predict = c("response")) %>%
  mutate(predicted_class = 
           factor(ifelse(.fitted > 0.5, "male", "female")))

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
pred_results %>% slice(1:5) %>% kable()

```

## **Predictive performance metrics**{.smaller}

We can use these predicted classes to compute different predictive performance/evaluation metrics

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![](tikz__pictures-1.png){fig-align="center" width="356"} 
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
The table can be interpreted as follows:
-   The *correct classification rate* (CCR) or *accuracy* describes the overall proportion of teaching instructors (males or females) that were classified correctly.

-   The *true positive rate* (TPR) or *sensitivity* (a.k.a. recall), denotes the proportion of actual male instructors that are correctly classified as males by the model.

-   The *true negative rate* (TNR) or *specificity*, denotes the proportion of actual females that have been classified correctly as females by the model.

-   The model's *precision* or *positive predictive value* (PPV) represents the proportion of predicted male instructors that were actually male

-   The model's *negative predictive value* (NPV) represents the proportion of predicted female instructors .
:::
::::

## ROC Curve

-   Plot true positive rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various **threshold** levels.

-   The closer the ROC curve is to the top-left corner, the better the model is at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes

![](roc.png){fig-align="center" width="374"}

## **Logistic regression with one categorical explanatory variable**

Instead of having a numerical explanatory variable such as `age`, let's now use the binary categorical variable `ethnicity` as our explanatory variable.

![](ethnicity.png){fig-align="center" width="422"}

## Fitting the model

```{r}
#| echo: true

evals.ethnic <- evals %>%
                  select(gender, ethnicity)
model.ethnic <- glm(gender ~ ethnicity,
                    data = evals.ethnic,
                    family = binomial) 
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

model.ethnic %>%
  tidy(conf.int = T) %>% kableExtra::kable(digits=2)
```

## Interpretation of model parameters {.smaller}

Lets break this down. The model we have fitted is:

$$
\mathrm{log}\left(\dfrac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right) = \alpha + \beta_{\mbox{ethnicity}}  \times \mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{ethnicity}}(\mathrm{not~  minority})
$$

-   $\alpha$ is the **intercept**, representing the **log-odds** when $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{ethnicity}}(\mathrm{not~ minority}) = 0$ (i.e., when the instructor is in the minority group).

    -   When the instructor belongs to the reference category `minority` the models simplifies to: $$\mathrm{log}\left(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right) = \alpha $$

-   $\beta_{\mathrm{ethnicity}}$ is the **coefficient** for the predictor $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{ethnicity}}(\mathrm{not~ minority})$, which shows how the log-odds change when moving from the reference category (`minority`) to the other level (`not minority`).

    -   When the instructor does **not** belong to reference category, i.e. $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{ethnicity}}(\mathrm{not~ minority}) = 1$, the model becomes: $$\mathrm{log}\left(\dfrac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right) = \alpha + \beta_{\mbox{ethnicity}}$$

So, the **log-odds** of the instructors being male in the `not minority` group are $\alpha +\beta_{\mbox{ethnicity}}$.

## The steps ahead

-   Calculate, using R, the logistic regression coefficients on the odds and probability scales when either a continuous or a categorical exploratory variable is used in the model.

-   Correct interpretation of the of the model parameters of a fitted logistic regression (in terms of the log-odds, odds and probabilities) with either a continuous or a categorical exploratory variable .

-   Check how to visualize the results of a fitted logistic regression with with either a continuous or a categorical exploratory variable.

-   Interpret the model diagnostic plots and predictive performance metrics of a logistic regression model.
